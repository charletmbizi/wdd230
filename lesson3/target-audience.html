<h1>Ex Africa Energy Planning Document</h1>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The audience for the site consists of home owners residing in new settlements which are not connected to grid electricity or 
        those resident in rural areas where electricity is not yet available. The intended site visitors are smartphone owners, aged 
        between twenty-five to fifty years of age with an average monthly income of $100.00. These are either small scale farmers, 
        government employees or small retail owners and /or workers. Since most solar systems are procured by men, the target personnel 
        are male.</p>
      <p>The store should be able to advise visitors on the available products and services in store as well as the prices. It should allow
        people to sign up and buy products using the site. It should also update scorelines of important football matches such as EPL and Laliga.
        It should also advise potential solar trainees on the expected weather forecast on the day of training.
