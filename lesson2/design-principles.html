      <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
      <h3>Simply Chocolate</h3>
      <p><a href="https://simplychocolate.dk">Simply Chocolate`s Web Address</a></p>
      <img src="images/Chocolate.PNG" alt="A mobile view screenshot* of an Simply Chocolate's web page that illustrates visual hierarchy">
      <p>Visual Hierarchy is used to rank design elements and influence in the order you want your users to view them. By using principles like 
        contrast, scale, balance and, more, you can help establish each element in its rightful place and help the most important elements stand 
        out. </p>
        <p>Simply Chocolate is in my opinion a great example of how to use size and scale to emphasize visual hierarchy. The first thing I am 
          drawn to in the design is the huge text that explains what the product is all about. This is done in a way that does not detract from the 
          other elements on the screen.</p>

      <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
      <h3>Kidizen Inc.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://kidizen.com">Kidizen`s Web Address</a></p>
      <img src="images/kidizen.JPG" alt="A mobile view screenshot* of an kidizen's web page that illustrates the rule of thirds">
      <p>In its most simple form the rule of thirds refers to a 3 by 3 grid that fits on top of any image. There are no specific sizes to the blocks 
        – only that they are equally shaped. The grid works horizontally or vertically and helps you determine how the eye follows an image or group 
        of images (such as a website).</p>
      <p>Kidizen used the rule of thirds to bring focus to their site. They used vertical  thirds as a focus throughout their site. The homepage is designed
        by grouping the image into thirds and focussing on the left side.</p>

      <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
      <h3>Apple</h3>
      <p><a href="https://apple.com">Apple`s Web Address</a></p>
      <img src="images/apple.JPG" alt="A mobile view screenshot* of an organization's web page that, in my opinion, illustrates that principle">
      <p>Apple sure do know how to confidently and properly use it in order to garner attention, sales and impact. Apple’s products are an art in 
        and of themselves and by using white space, the visitor only has one focus at any given time. No distractions here.</p>
