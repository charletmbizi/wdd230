      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>Most of the modern-human needs are powered by electricity. Think of all the activities you did today. What portion of those 
        activities interacted with electricity? Probably a majority of them. Now think of those who are not connected to electricity 
        because their houses are not yet connected to grid electricity. How are they surviving? Ex Africa Energy provides the 
        unconnected households with electricity to power their essential needs on a budget. In addition, the company supplies them with small 
        solar gadgets that bring convenience to their lives.</p>
